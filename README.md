# Basic to Advanced Studies  
Projects to practice and enhance my programming skills.  

## Overview  
This repository is a collection of projects designed to help me improve my programming abilities, starting with the basics of web development and gradually evolving into more advanced implementations.  

## Objectives  
- Begin with foundational web technologies: **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
- Practice core programming concepts and logical thinking through small, self-contained projects.  
- Transition to more complex features by integrating additional programming languages.  
- Make the projects dynamic and interactive by introducing **databases** and back-end functionalities.  
- Experiment with full-stack development to build comprehensive and scalable applications.  

## Current Focus  
The initial phase of this repository focuses on learning the fundamentals of web development:  
- Building simple and clean user interfaces with HTML and CSS.  
- Adding interactivity using JavaScript.  

## Future Plans  
1. **Expand Language Scope**:  
   Introduce back-end technologies, such as **PHP**, **Node.js**, or **Python**, to enhance functionality.  

2. **Database Integration**:  
   Incorporate databases like **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, or **MongoDB** to manage and store data.  

3. **Dynamic Features**:  
   Add user authentication, data manipulation, and other interactive features.  

4. **Full-Stack Applications**:  
   Work towards creating fully functional applications, combining front-end, back-end, and database technologies.  

5. **Deployment**:  
   Deploy projects to platforms like **GitHub Pages**, **Heroku**, or **Vercel**, making them accessible online.  

## Project Structure  


## Why This Repository?
